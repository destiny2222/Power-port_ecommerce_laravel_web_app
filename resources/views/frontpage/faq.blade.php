                            Yes! Our solar generators can be recharged from solar panels, Grid power(NEPA), as well as generators
                            Each unit is supplied with an AC charger and an optional charge controller as well as solar panel.

                        The runtime of our generators are solely dependent on your deviceâ€™s power consumption. 

                        However, each model of our solar generators have detailed description of an estimated runtime for a particular type of load.
                        
                        Higher models run bigger loads and run longer than lower models

                        Our solar generators are ruggedly made to last up to 10 years. The lithium battery may grow weak over this period. It can be replaced so you keep on enjoying your generator for many more years.
